# Cpp
Here all my c++ practice code


<h1>Compile-time Errors</h1>
When we are writing C++ programs, the compiler is our first line of defense against errors.

There are two types of compile-time errors:

<h1>Syntax errors</h1>
  Errors that occur when we violate the rules of C++ syntax.
<h1>Type errors</h1>
  Errors that occur when there are mismatch between the types we declared.
Some common syntax errors are:
<li>Missing semicolon</li>
<li>Missing closing parenthesis ) </li>
<li>square bracket ]</li>
<li>curly brace } <li>
Some common type errors are:

Forgetting to declare a variable
Storing a value into the wrong type

<h1>Link-time Errors</h1>
Some common link-time errors:

<li>Using a function that was never defined (more on this later)</li>
<li>Writing Main()</li> 
<li>instead of main()</li>

<h1>Run-time Errors</h1>
Some common run-time errors:
<li>Division by zero also known as division error.</li> <p>These types of error are hard to find as the compiler doesn’t point to the line at which the error occurs.</p>
<li>Trying to open a file that doesn’t exist</li>

<h1>Logic Errors</h1>
<p>Once we have removed the compile-time errors, link-time errors, and run-time errors, the program runs successfully. But sometimes, the program doesn’t do what we want it to do or no output is produced. yummm</p>
Some common logic errors:
<li>Program logic is flawed</li>
<li>Some “silly” mistake in an if statement or a for/while loop</li>
<h3>Note: Logic errors don’t have error messages. Sometimes</h3>
