# Cpp
Here all my c++ practice code


<h1>Compile-time Errors</h1>
When we are writing C++ programs, the compiler is our first line of defense against errors.

There are two types of compile-time errors:

<h1>Syntax errors</h1>
  Errors that occur when we violate the rules of C++ syntax.
<h1>Type errors</h1>
  Errors that occur when there are mismatch between the types we declared.
Some common syntax errors are:
<li>Missing semicolon</li>
<li>Missing closing parenthesis ) </li>
<li>square bracket ]</li>
<li>curly brace } <li>
Some common type errors are:

Forgetting to declare a variable
Storing a value into the wrong type

<h1>Link-time Errors</h1>
Some common link-time errors:

<li>Using a function that was never defined (more on this later)</li>
<li>Writing Main()</li> 
<li>instead of main()</li>
